The Effects of Temperature and Pressure on the Espresso Brewing Process

Our study is based on “A new method for Espresso Coffee brewing: Caffe Firenze,” by Parenti, Guerrini, Masella, Dainelli, and Spugnoli, published in the Journal of Agricultural Engineering (2014) The data which we will be using is simulated data which shares the same mean and standard deviation. The dependent variables are temperature, and pressure. The dependent variable is the ratio of Crema to liquid in percentage. Our null hypothesis is that 
the temperature and pressure have no effect on the crema ratio. Our alternative hypothesis is that either – or both – of pressure and temperature influence the ratio of crema.
